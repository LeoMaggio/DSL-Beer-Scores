# Predicting Beer Quality Score - DSL2021

Final project for the Data Science Lab course @Politecnico di Torino, A.Y. 2020/21.

Further details are provided in our paper: [An Ensemble Approach to Predict Beer Quality Score](https://github.com/LeoMaggio/DSL-Beer-Scores/blob/main/Maggio_292938_Report.pdf).

We propose a possible approach to predict the quality score associated with a beer review. First, we handle missing values and perform feature extraction through tf-idf and one-hot encoding. Then, different regression models are trained on this processed data and compared. Finally, the best performing models are combined in an ensemble, obtaining a fulfilling result.
